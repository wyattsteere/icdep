# anti-dupe
***Anti-Duplication Protocol for Index Card Data Exchange Protocol***

The most straightforward way to ensure that packets are received once and only once is to have the recipient provide a response that they received the packet. If there is no confirmation sent, then the sender can assume that the packet was not received and will send another one. Additionally, there could be a unique identification number (only must be unique to this current session) added to the packet and if multiple of the same packet (matching identification numbers) is received then the packet will be ignored. This would act as a plan B if the confirmation is not sent after the recipient successfully receives the packet, therefore the recipient would receive two identical packets and would ignore the duplicate.
